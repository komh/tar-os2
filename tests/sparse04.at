AT_SETUP([storing long sparse file names])
AT_KEYWORDS([sparse sparse04])

# Description: Tar versions from 1.15.92 to 1.25 would incorrectly
# store sparse file names longer than 100 characters in pax mode.
# Namely, the `path' keyword of the produced PAX header would contain the
# crafted name of the header itself, instead of that of the file.
